### Looger : winston

<b> NOTE </b> : I have an understanding that adding a logger on a small scale project is like putting sword in needle battles. But here the purpose is to follow production grade tools and pratices. Aim is to learn about how to build business class projects.

```
npm install winston
```

Then create a custom logger
