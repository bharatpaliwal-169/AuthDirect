# AuthDirect

package added : express, body-parser , nodemon , cors , dotenv , mongoose .
## v1

Implement function based bare basic auth with 3 functions:

```
login() , signup() , forgotPassword()
```

### Looger : winston

<b> NOTE </b> : I have an understanding that adding a logger on a small scale project is like putting sword in needle battles. But here the purpose is to follow production grade tools and pratices. Aim is to learn about how to build business class projects.

```
npm install winston
```

an example of using logger in express with express-winston
```
 app.use(expressWinston.logger({
   winstonInstance : logger,
   meta : true,
   msg: 'HTTP {{req.method}} {{req.url}} {{req.body}}',
   expressFormat:true,
   colorize:true
 }));
 
```


Then create a custom logger

REf : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56090851/winston-logging-object

then implement it everywhere

# BUG ? ISSUE

<p> 
This is to be observed that, when handling objects in controllers then we need to take care of using 
```
newUSer = {...user,prop:newValues} <- this dosent works for some reason
we need to use $set:{prop:newValue} instead
```
else what can be done is to fetch object from DB then destruct it and rebuild as construct then send as const object
```
const obj = {all , props , here};
const new = {prop : newval , here};
db.fidu(new);
```

this took almost a day to get figure out, JS hell! ðŸ’€
</p>

### Req/res compression 

```
app.use(compression({
  level: 6, // set the compression level to 6
  threshold: 1024, // compress responses larger than 1024 bytes
  filter: (req, res) => {
    if (req.headers['content-type'] === 'application/json') {
      // exclude JSON responses from compression
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
}));

```
